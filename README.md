### Welcome to my github, in which I showcase examples of my work (i.e. why I am the perfect hire for you).

- Scientific computing:
  - [My BSc thesis](https://github.com/dsmordasov/ares_awesizer)
    - Design tool for the sizing of an airborne wind energy system of a Martian habitat.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib + seaborn packages).
    - Computational modeling, optimisation, sexy flow diagram.

  - [My MSc Thesis](https://github.com/dsmordasov/wake_diffusion_rotor)
    - A set of scripts for running computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on the DTU HPC cluster, investigating a novel wind turbine design and its performance in wind farms.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, Matplotlib and Xarray packages), along with PyWakeEllipSys CFD and HAWC2S aeroservoelastic code.
    - CFD simulation set-up and execution on a Linux supercluster, data analysis and visualisation, insight extraction. 

 
- Videogame development:
  - [The Ratcatcher](https://github.com/dsmordasov/dmitrijs_roguelike)
    - A hobby roguelike game, set in the story of the **The Ratcatcher** novel by _Viktor Dyk_.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, libtcod and PyInstaller packages).
    - Objective-oriented programming, procedural level generation, own game engine, PyInstaller/GitHub-deployed for Win/MacOS/Linux compatibility.
