### Welcome to my GitHub, in which I showcase examples of my work (i.e. why I am the perfect hire for you).

- Data Science:
  - [Drink and study](https://github.com/dsmordasov/drink_and_study)
    - An investigation into the influence of various socio-economic factors on student's performance, assignment for an 'Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Mining' MSc course.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib + seaborn packages and PyTorch wrapper code from professors).
    - Exploratory data analysis (feature extraction, statistics, principal component analysis, data visualisation), machine learning (artificial neural networks, linear and logistic regression, cross-validation), insight extraction.

- Scientific computing:
  - [My MSc Thesis](https://github.com/dsmordasov/wake_diffusion_rotor)
    - A set of scripts for running computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on the DTU HPC cluster, investigating a novel wind turbine design for regulating wind turbine wakes and improving wind farm yields.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, Matplotlib and Xarray packages), along with PyWakeEllipSys (CFD) and HAWC2S (aeroservoelastic code).
    - PyWakeEllipSys simulation set-up and execution on a Linux HPC cluster, automated data analysis and visualisation pipeline for the CFD results, code for integrated wind turbine blade design with consequent evaluation in HAWC2S and output into a PyWakeEllipSys readable input, insight extraction. 

  - [My BSc thesis](https://github.com/dsmordasov/ares_awesizer)
    - Design tool for the sizing of an airborne wind energy system (power kite) for a Martian habitat.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib + seaborn packages).
    - Computational modeling, optimisation, code verification, sexy flow diagram.
 
- Videogame development:
  - [The Ratcatcher](https://github.com/dsmordasov/dmitrijs_roguelike)
    - A hobby roguelike game, set in the story of the **The Ratcatcher** novel by _Viktor Dyk_.
    - :snake:Python (NumPy, libtcod and PyInstaller packages).
    - Objective-oriented programming, entity component system, procedural level generation, own game engine, game design. Automated PyInstaller/GitHub distribution deployment with Win/MacOS/Linux compatibility.
